This project was created in Visual Studio version 2022. I would recommend opening in VS 2022, and once it is open
you should be able to click 'debug' or 'start without debugging'. I built the program using C# taking advantage 
of classes, methods, ect. I also made sure to break up the code in specific files to keep it neat and consistent. 
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
